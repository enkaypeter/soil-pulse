LED Orientation (Polarity)

LEDs have a positive (anode) and negative (cathode) lead.
The longer leg is usually the anode (positive), and it should connect to the GPIO pin (through a resistor).
The shorter leg is usually the cathode (negative), and it should go to GND.
If you insert the LED backwards, it will not light.
